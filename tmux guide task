To customize your tmux configuration file, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Use a text editor such as `nano` or `vim` to create or edit your `.tmux.conf` file. You can do this by running:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.tmux.conf
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   vim ~/.tmux.conf
   ```

3. Copy and paste the configurations from the tutorial into your `.tmux.conf` file.

4. Save the changes and exit the text editor.

5. Optionally, you can further customize the configurations according to your preferences.

6. Test your tmux configurations by restarting tmux or reloading the configuration file. You can do this by running:

   ```bash
   tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
   ```

Once you've customized your tmux configuration, you can submit the updated `.tmux.conf` file. After that, I can help you create a PDF explaining the most useful customization you found and why, as well as designing a nice formHam logo.
